Quantitative results on the Phototourism dataset [13] for NRW [22], NeRF [24], and two ablations of the proposed model. Best results are highlighted. NeRF-W outperforms the previous state of the art across all datasets on PSNR and MS-SSIM and achieves competitive results in LPIPS. Note that LPIPS generally favours methods such as NRW trained with an adversarial or perceptual loss and it is less sensitive to typical GAN artifacts, see Figures 7 and 14 (supplementary).
